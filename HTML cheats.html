             <p> 
                 Let's start with the basics! We already know what HTML is being used for,
                 but what does designing and creating various webpages consist of?
                 Well, first we need to define one of the very basics of HTML structure, 
                 called 'elements' here below us is an example of an element.
             </p>
                 <br>
                 <img 
                 src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/692005070363033704/715828110645395466/element_example.png"
                  width="1000" length="1000">
                 <!--<p>YES! I am the content within the element, 
                     sandwiched by two tags, the opening one and the closing one!</p>-->

          
      
        </div>
        <div>
        <h2 id="testing"> Ok, but what are tags? </h2>
       <p>
           Tags are what define the element, if, for example, you have the &lt;p&gt; 
               tag this is a paragraph element,
                it is used to write and display text that you see on this very page!
                You don't only have tags for displaying text however,
                 you also have tags that define the document as a whole,
                  like &lt;html&gt;, within this element is where everything is stored.

       </p>
    </div>

<p>
    This in mind, it's very important to know how to structure an html document for it to work properly, 
    first, type this into your console.

  <p>
   This is a must if you want your browser to recognize your document as an html file to display,
     it needs to come before any other tags or elements, next you need the &lt;html&gt; element as I explained 
     then, a  &lt;head&gt; which holds the metadata of the page and generally 
     it doesn't show anything on the page itself. it goes before the next important element, which is 
     &lt;body&gt;. Here you will be putting the majority of your actual content.
